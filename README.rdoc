A Rails application that facilitates partially automated completed of housing title record forms in Wake County, North Carolina.

The app draws from public housing and tax databases to automatically populate tax and housing value information from a single query. This eliminates the need for tedious back-and-forth manual database searching, typically the job of real estate paralegals. With this app, a real estate lawyer can bypass the most time-consuming part of the paperwork.

The app also integrates all other aspects of the form, such as client information, mortgages, liens, etc., and features a mailer that will automatically email the completed form to a specified address.
